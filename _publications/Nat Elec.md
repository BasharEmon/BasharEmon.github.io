Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are essential components in many electronic technologies for consumer and industrial applications. Such devices are typically made using materials selected to support long operational lifetimes, but MEMS designed to physically disintegrate or to dissolve after a targeted period could provide a route to reduce electronic waste and could enable applications that require a finite operating timeframe, such as temporary medical implants. Here we report ecoresorbable and bioresorbable MEMS that are based on fully water-soluble material platforms and can either naturally resorb into the environment to eliminate solid waste or in the body to avoid a need for surgical extraction. We illustrate the biocompatibility of the approach with mechanobiology, histology and haematology studies of the implanted devices and their dissolution end products. We also demonstrate bioresorbable encapsulating materials and deployment strategies in small animal models to reduce device damage, confine mobile fragments and provide robust adhesion with adjacent tissues.
