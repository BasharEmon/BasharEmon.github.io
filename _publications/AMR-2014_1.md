Nanotechnology has taken the world of science by a storm and construction industry is no exception. The most important aspect of construction industry that can be influenced by nanotechnology is cement and concrete. Recent research on application of carbon nanotubes (CNT), both single-walled and multi-walled, shows significant increase in mechanical properties of concrete. Other properties of concrete e.g. durability, permeability, cement hydration etc. can be conveniently influenced with the help of Alkali-Silicate Reaction (ASR) studies, nanoScale Silica Fume, integration of nanoParticles in cement-synthesis and a lot other methods. And as a matter of fact, the future of cement based construction industry seems to be shaped by nanotechnology as even developing countries like Bangladesh are coming forward now-a-days to harness the potential of this rapid growing field.
