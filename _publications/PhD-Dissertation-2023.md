Cell generated force plays critical roles in regulating tissue mechanics and functions during many
physiological and pathological processes. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer cells
recruit and transform the stromal fibroblasts into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that become
highly contractile. Increased CAF contractility increases mechanical stiffness of the extracellular
matrices (ECM) in the stroma and helps the cancer cells to metastasize. This doctoral research
focused on how the TME stiffness and CAF contractility change with time; and how this process
regulates pro-metastatic crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells.
The first challenge in the study was measuring cell force for an extended period of time using
monochromatic light for traction force microscopy. It was found that light adversely affects the
CAFs and relaxes their contractility. To avoid photo-toxicity, we sought to find a light intensity
that is safe for long exposure during experiments. After rigorous investigation of cell traction
relaxation with intensity and wavelength sweep, we determined dose-independent threshold
intensities for common wavelengths used in microscopy.
The safe imaging protocol enabled us to measure cell contractility and examine the role of CAF
force in metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We controlled cell force by tuning substrate
stiffness (elastic modulus, E = 1, 10 and 40 kPa) and found that CAF contractility increases with
increasing stiffness. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses identified that higher force upregulates
expressions of pro-metastatic genes such as TGFβ, ILs, FGFs, CXCLs; and pathways linked to
Yes Associated Protein (YAP). Remarkably, we found that activin A (a cytokine from the TGFβ
family) secretion by the CAFs highly increases with elevated cell force. We also found that CAF-
iii
secreted activin A induces cancer cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT),
indicating that increased TME stiffness leads to force-mediated activin A signaling.
These experiments provided novel insights, with the limitation of having cells on 2D substrates.
However, cells in the TME generate traction on the surrounding three-dimensional matrices that
change with time. There was no method available to directly quantify single-cell forces and matrix
remodeling in 3D. To address this gap, we microfabricated a high-resolution sensor that hosts a
3D tissue formed by self-assembly of cells and ECM. This sensor can measure cell forces (with 1-
nN resolution) and changes in the tissue stiffness. We measured single and multicellular force
dynamics and found that CAF/cancer cell co-culture significantly increased ECM (collagen I)
stiffness. This provided evidence that crosstalk between cancer cells and CAFs facilitates matrix
remodeling and metastatic progression.
Enabled by the sensor, we explored the biomolecular origin of cell response to stiffness/force in
3D and tested the hypothesis that CAF-cancer cell crosstalk is sustained by force-activated YAP
(a transcription co-activator that controls critical oncogenes including TGFβ). YAP is
mechanosensitive; however, mechanical activation of YAP remains unclear. To understand the
mechanism of YAP activation, we controlled cell traction phenotypes utilizing a diverse set of
culture microenvironments (2D to 3D); and assessed how stiffness and ECM affect force dynamics
to identify the role of stiffness, cell spreading area, force, and nuclear deformation in activating
YAP. These results showed that force induced nuclear deformation has the strongest correlation
with YAP activation.
Going forward, a future study can be investigating whether YAP is implicated in crosstalk between
CAF and cancer cells. We can also explore the possibility of utilizing cell force, nuclear
deformation, and YAP to develop novel prognostic and therapeutic strategies against cancer.
