Understanding the molecular and physical complexity of the tissue microenvironment (TiME) in the context of its spatiotemporal organization has remained an enduring challenge. Recent advances in engineering and data science are now promising the ability to study the structure, functions, and dynamics of the TiME in unprecedented detail; however, many advances still occur in silos that rarely integrate information to study the TiME in its full detail. This review provides an integrative overview of the engineering principles underlying chemical, optical, electrical, mechanical, and computational science to probe, sense, model, and fabricate the TiME. In individual sections, we first summarize the underlying principles, capabilities, and scope of emerging technologies, the breakthrough discoveries enabled by each technology and recent, promising innovations. We provide perspectives on the potential of these advances in answering critical questions about the TiME and its role in various disease and developmental processes. Finally, we present an integrative view that appreciates the major scientific and educational aspects in the study of the TiME.
