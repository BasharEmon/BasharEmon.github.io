Foundry-compatible materials and processing approaches serve as the foundations for advanced, active implantable microsystems that can dissolve in biofluids into biocompatible reaction products, with broad potential applications in biomedicine. The results reported here include in vitro studies of the dissolution kinetics and nanoscale bioresorption behaviors of device-grade thin films of Si, SiNx, SiO2, and W in the presence of dynamic cell cultures via atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. In situ investigations of cell–extracellular mechanotransduction induced by cellular traction provide insights into the cytotoxicity of these same materials and of microcomponents formed with them using foundry-compatible processes, indicating potential cytotoxicity elicited by W at concentrations greater than 6 mM. The findings are of central relevance to the biocompatibility of modern Si-based electronics technologies as active, bioresorbable microsystems that interface with living tissues.
