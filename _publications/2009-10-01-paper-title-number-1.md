Yes Associated Protein (YAP), a transcription cofactor, has been identified as one of the drivers of cancer progression. High tumor stiffness is attributed to driving YAP to the nucleus, wherein it activates pro-metastatic genes. Here we show, using cancer associated fibroblasts, that YAP translocation to the nucleus depends on the degree of nuclear deformation, irrespective of stiffness. We also identified that perinuclear force induced membrane curvature correlates strongly with YAP nuclear transport. A novel stochastic model of YAP kinetics unveiled a power law relationship between the activation threshold and persistence time of YAP in the nucleus. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing YAP dynamics and the probability of activation that is of immense clinical significance.
