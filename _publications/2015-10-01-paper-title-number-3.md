Cell–matrix interactions, mediated by cellular force and matrix remodeling, result in dynamic reciprocity that drives numerous biological processes and disease progression. Currently, there is no available method for directly quantifying cell traction force and matrix remodeling in three-dimensional matrices as a function of time. To address this long-standing need, we developed a high-resolution microfabricated device that enables longitudinal measurement of cell force, matrix stiffness and the application of mechanical stimulation (tension or compression) to cells. Here a specimen comprising of cells and matrix self-assembles and self-integrates with the sensor. With primary fibroblasts, cancer cells and neurons we have demonstrated the feasibility of the sensor by measuring single or multiple cell force with a resolution of 1 nN and changes in tissue stiffness due to matrix remodeling by the cells. The sensor can also potentially be translated into a high-throughput system for clinical assays such as patient-specific drug and phenotypic screening. We present the detailed protocol for manufacturing the sensors, preparing experimental setup, developing assays with different tissues and for imaging and analyzing the data. Apart from microfabrication of the molds in a cleanroom (one time operation), this protocol does not require any specialized skillset and can be completed within 4–5 h.
