Overview 
------
Inspired by how mechanical environment (stiffness, microstructure), forces and strains influence the rules of life, my research explores pathophysiology through the lens of mechanics. I have been trained in theoretical and experimental mechanics which allows me to focus on cellular and tissue biomechanics. I explore the role of cellular forces on their behavior and function, particularly within the tumor microenvironment, with the ultimate goal of translating these insights into clinical applications. 

During my PhD, under the supervision of Professor Taher Saif, I developed a novel experimental platform that allows, for the first time, measuring single cell forces in 3D matrices and forming in vitro tumors with primary cancer cells and stromal cells that assist the cancer cells (published in [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf2629) & [Nature Protocols](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-024-01106-8)). Cell forces could only be measured for cells on a 2D soft elastic substrate from the substrate deformation. However, cells in organs are in a 3D environment. Cell forces in 3D matrices could not be measured due to non-linearity and/or local remodeling of the matrix. I overcame this limitation by inventing a sensor platform that takes advantage of force balance to measure cell-generated forces.

In addition, this sensor platform can simultaneously monitor/measure the evolution of matrix mechanical properties, and test drug efficacy in cancer treatment. This method marks a significant advancement in the field as this platform solved a long-standing problem of directly measuring force dynamics in an active matrix, which mimics in vivo mechanical microenvironment. 

My long-term goal is to apply cell and tissue mechanics to develop therapeutic strategies and design innovative medical devices that can transform patient care. I am eager to establish interdisciplinary collaborations and expand my research by exploring the role of cell contractility, local stress and matrix mechanical properties in fundamental cell functions. I aim to uncover significant clinical insights and develop translational technologies that apply engineering mechanics to medical applications.
